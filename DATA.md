# Data Observations

## Assumptions

  + Data available in PDF format, organized according to a common structure.
    + Data on first page of PDF only.
    + Sections order may differ from year-to-year.
    + Regardless of section order, there are 53 lines per page.

## Decisions

  + Don't care about full-time vs part-time columns. Only care about row totals (last column).
  + Given different section order from year-to-year, focus on 2015 structure first.
